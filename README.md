# ChartingModule -Nextjs application
I used Lightweight charts as a chart module along with axios library for making http requests
To start the application:
npm run dev

Refer master branch for the code
Chart.tsx contains the code of the application
CandleChartData.tsx and VolumeChart.tsx are not used
